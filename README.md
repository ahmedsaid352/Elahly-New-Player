## Al-Ahly signed a unique African striker, strong, scorer, fast, and an international player, and his height is 186 cm.
### I want to identify this player, so I used web scraping to pull the data of international African players with a height of 186 cm, and I wrote it in Sheet Excel to ### analyze the data and filter the positions to predict the player and I got that shortlist.
### The first file in the name of the qualifiers includes all the data of all the teams, it outputs a file called allExpectedPlayers, while the other file in the name of the cup includes data of the last teams of the African Nations Cup, it outputs a file called ExpectedPlayers
